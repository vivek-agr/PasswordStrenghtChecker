1. Password Criteria:
Define the criteria for a strong password. Here are some common considerations:
Minimum length: 8 characters
Character types: Include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
Common patterns: Avoid dictionary words, keyboard patterns (e.g., "qwerty"), and simple repetitions (e.g., "12345").

2. Password Analysis Functions:
Length check: Define a function to check if the password meets the minimum length requirement.
Character type check: Define a function to check if the password contains at least one uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, and special symbol. You can use regular expressions for this.

3. Common Pattern Check (Optional):
You can implement a function to check for dictionary words using a comparison list or external resources (be mindful of licensing and online dependencies).

4. Strength Meter:
Assign points based on the fulfilled criteria (e.g., +1 for each character type, +2 for exceeding minimum length).
Define a rating system based on the total points (e.g., "Weak" for low points, "Strong" for high points).

5. User Interaction:
Prompt the user to enter their password.
Call the analysis functions and calculate the strength score.
Display a message indicating the password strength and any suggestions for improvement (e.g., "Password is weak, include at least one uppercase letter").


Explanation:

The check_length function verifies if the password length is greater than or equal to 8.
The check_character_types function uses regular expressions to search for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
The check_strength function combines the checks, assigns points, and determines the overall strength with a corresponding message.
The main function prompts for user input, calls the strength check, and displays the results.

Remember: This is a basic example. You can enhance it by:
Implementing a more comprehensive common pattern check.
Providing more granular strength feedback with suggestions based on missing criteria.
Using a visual meter (text-based or progress bar) to represent password strength.
